# LendMIT-frontend

## User Journey
Jenna got invited to a pink-and-white themed high tea party with a formal dress code. She realizes that she has nothing pink-and-white to wear, so she decides to try out LendMIT which she has heard good things about from her peers. She signs up for an account, verifies her MIT email, and then enters the MatchBoard page.

She searches up "dress" in the search bar and looks through all the postings. She doesn't find any dresses that fit her criteria, so she wants to create a post. Before doing so, she updates her profile with a profile picture and bio in case anyone checks out her profile. She then goes to the "My Postings" page to create a post. She titles it "Looking for a Pink or White Formal Dress (size 0-2)", selects her role as a "borrower", tags her post under the "Clothing $ Costumes" category, and adds in a short description. It now shows up in her "My Postings" page and on the top of the "MatchBoard" page.

Further, she goes onto the "Subscriptions" page to subscribe to the "Clothing $ Costumes" category, so she'll get notified about future postings in this category. She logs out, and waits for people to see her post.
